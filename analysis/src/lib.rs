//! This crate contains a set of helpers to build static analysis tools based
//! on [abstract interpretation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_interpretation).
//! The building blocks include helpers for
//! [control flow graphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control-flow_graph),
//! creating [lattice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lattice_(order)) domains,
//! and common analyses like
//! calculating the [dominator sets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominator_(graph_theory)).
//! There are also a set of concrete lattice
//! implementations like bitset lattice, map lattice, and sign lattice.
//!
//! In the future, I plan to extend this crate with more elaborate numerical
//! domains, as well as helpers to build analyses based on symbolic execution.
//!
//! Look at the domains-lib crate for an example how to define analyses using
//! the helpers in this crate.
//!
