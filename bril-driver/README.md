# Bril, an educational intermediate representation

Bril (the Big Red Intermediate Language) is a compiler IR made for teaching [CS 6120][cs6120], a grad compilers course.
It is an extremely simple instruction-based IR that is meant to be extended, see the [documentation][docs] and
the [language reference document][langref] for details. This repository contains a parser for the textual form,
an interpreter, and a static analyzer for the Bril Core language.
